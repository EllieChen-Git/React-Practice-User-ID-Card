# React Practice - User ID Card

### Instruction

- Create a react app that will accept a username and email address.

##### Wireframe:

![wireframe](./public/wireframe.png)

##### Core:

- As the user types the username and email should be displayed below a avatar picture on the right

##### Advanced (Updated instruction - different from wireframe):

- Add extra event listeners to the form so that some extra information appears when a user starts to type etc

##### Beast (Updated instruction - different from wireframe):

- Please refactor the above challenge to lift state so that the left and right components are two different components.
